### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 7 was a favorite of mine because I thought it was interesting on how to use command line arguments.
    I also learned how to play BlackJack in the process of completing this lab. I also enjoyed "creating"
    my own sandwich in part 1!


* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was also one of my favorites because learning about boolean logic was challenging.
    I struggled a lot with this lab, but after figuring out what to do, I was satisfied with the result.
    I learned that boolean expressions are a key idea in programming. 



* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was one of my favorites because I enjoyed learning about loops. Loops are a bit tricky to work
    with at first, but once I was able to get the hang of them, I enjoyed the lab. I learned that loops
    are essential to making a program repeat itself.
